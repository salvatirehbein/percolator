### percolator 0.4.0 (Release date: 2021-01-27)

  the other filters. In this sense, one can run any filter in the
  file after read_tb or read_pcp.
- Add classif filter in filtra_a in order to select the new systems, 
  etc. This was the major fault in the filters before.

  eficient and doesn't depend one each other.
- Add examples and documentation in English

- Change package name from fortracc.deal to percolator.
- Added fortran subroutines (src/pcp.f90 and src/tb.f90) for

  from "block" style to plain text files to be read by the percolator.
  These subroutines are called by the read_pcp and read_tb functions.
