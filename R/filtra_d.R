#' Filter by maximum distance and minimum size (ForTraCC correction type filter)
#' 
#' @description ForTraCC is an automated method for tracking cloud systems. Two little deficiencies
#' were found for tracking with very large datasets for long periods. This function
#' is designed to eliminated the families that were erroneously included in the fam file.
#' In this sense, this filter calculates MCSs displacement between consecutive timestamps, 
#' filter out familieswith larger surrealistic displacements between two consecutive 
#' timesteps, and filter out families with size lower than the threshold 
#' predefined in fortracc_input.
#'
#' @param ifile Character. Input filename. Generally as c_YYYYMM.txt
#' @param ofile Character. Output filename. Sugested: d_YYYYMM.txt
#' @param min_size Numeric. This is the size threshold in pixels to exclude MCSs 
#' that ForTraCC erroneously inserted in the fam_ final files.
#' @param dist_max Numeric. Maximum distance in km allowed between two consecutive timesteps.
#' ForTraCC sometimes connects two no related cloud systems. This filter remove the 
#' entire family when the distance between two consecutive timesteps are larger than 
#' the threshold defined. By default it is 300 km (recommended for 30 min timesteps)
#' @param coords Vector of strings with the coordinates (longitude, latitude) field names.
#' By default it is c("XLON", "YLAT").
